            <p>I graduated from ODU in Spring 2020 with a degree in Computer Science. During undergrad, I took on an intership with the City of Virginia 
                Beach IT department working alongside System engineers. Upon graduating, I landed a job as a Software Engineer which is my current position 
                and now i'm working towards getting my masters degree in Computer Science.
